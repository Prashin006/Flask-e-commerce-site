Deployed on PythonAnywhere

Had some issues with library installation so did the following installs from bash
    pip install email_validator
    pip install Flask-Migrate (for db migration)

Made a virtual environment in PythonAnywhere using following commands 
    mkvirtualenv myflaskenv 

Database migration required as User and Item models were not made
Used following commands from bash (terminal) in PythonAnywhere environment:
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
    flask db upgrade

In the file structure we can modify the python .py code files to apply changes appropriately then click Reload 
Use the bash (terminal) to add items using the following code:
    from market import db, app
    from market.models import Item
    item = Item(name='Dell XPS',price=999,barcode='829292929292',description='alkdfjlakdfjlkasdjfads')
    with app.app_context():
        db.session.add(item)
        db.session.commit()
